**My Favorite Movies/Series!**

1. Arcane
2. Breaking Bad
3. Transformers: One

## Arcane
> "Everyone makes mistakes, right?"

### Arcane is based on the game League of Legends, and it is a story about many things, it has so much going for it and even though there's a lot happening I was never overwhelmed watching it. It is a entertaining and fun watch, I would recommend it to anyone especially as the second season is currently airing.

## Breaking Bad
> "I am the danger!"

### Breaking bad is one of the best fiction stories made, the character arcs are execellent and it provides some insights about the different type of people. One of the best thing about this series is the protagonist and his changes, this series is dark and griddy with many themes that are not suitable for younger audience.

## Transformers: One
> "What defines a Transformer is not the cog in his chest, but the Spark that resides in their core. A Spark that gives you the will to make your world better."

### Transformers: One is a brand new movie in the transformer saga, it is a prequel and serves as a great introduction to the series, we see the past and what happened before the fights between autobots and decepticons, I don't want to spoil anything about it but I recommend people to watch it.

*this is are some of the series/movies I like.*
